# CPEN 513 Assignment 1
CPEN 513 CAD Algorithms for Integrated Circuits

# Usage
Run src/main.py with a Python 3.9 interpreter

A routing window should be displayed upon running the file.

Press 'a' or 'd' to select the A* or Dijkstra routing algorithm, respectively.
Once selected, the algorithm cannot be changed without restarting the program.

After selecting an algorithm, press a number key indicating
how many steps you would like the algorithm to perform. 
E.g. Pressing '1' triggers a single step while '5' triggers five steps.
Pressing '0' will run the entire program to completion, including all rip-up and reroute stages.
